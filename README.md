# midterm

This is my midterm project for MSTU5013 at Teacher's College. It's a simple soundboard used with Vue.js. Seems easy, but the kind of stuff I tried to do took up too much time and was unnecessary to be honest. I got the buttons to load 1 at a time (I tried to have 11-20 load after 1-10, but I just couldn't.). I also tried to get the images to change on hover, but I guess I couldn't do that either...

Anyway, there are two sets of buttons:
1. Windows sounds
2. Random sounds

The buttons, when hovered, increase in size. I tried making the size relative to screen size, but I couldn't get a 1:1 aspect ratio, so here we are.

Anyway, enjoy the sound board. Not aesthetically pleasing, but I am a back-end developer afterall...
